# Lulu | Once In A Lifetime #
## Interactive Front-end Web Development Project ##

## Aim ##

The aim of this project is to build a static website of an imaginary South East Asian tour of the Scottish singer [Lulu](https://github.com/Paddlepop25/trent-project1-lulu-website). I discovered her music in my late teens and even though she was from my father's era, I found that I enjoyed many of her songs. I have not experienced her real live concert and this is a figment of my imagination of which cities would have hosted her, as well as the materials used to introduce and promote her to the audience in this part of the world. I name this 'Once In A Lifetime' because it would be a dream come true if she would ever tour in my region because it is rather far from the UK, so hence the project title.

## UX ##

I designed this project starting with a mobile first design approach, and also including medium and larger sized screens. Wireframes were created to help me visualise the website, and I intended the overall design to be clean, modern and easy to navigate.

Wireframes for small, medium and large devices can be viewed via this link - [wireframes](https://github.com/Paddlepop25/trent-project1-lulu-website/tree/master/wireframes)

Colors were especially used to achieve this objective. I wanted the website to have a primary orange theme color (#ed7d33) to accentuate information on the singer with a secondary color of black and white as supporting roles. The bright orange in contrast to the dark tones would highlight important elements like buying tickets for her concert tour and reading more news on her life. On the hover state for links, the orange color will change to a darker tone to indicate the use to click on the links. I specifically chose a dark textered background to set a comfortable mood and flow with only her pictures in non-greyscaled colors. 


These are the user stories that I intended to achieve while building this website:
1. Showcase Lulu's vast music career through pictures of her concert performances in big venues
2. Have the website available in the major languages for the South East Asian countries she would be touring in
3. Have a 'clutter-free' and clean looking website with links to external sources on more information on purchasing her tour tickets, news and cd albums
4. To have the users' eyes flow follow the website smoothly downwards so I placed the titles and information towards the center of the screen 
5. To get repeated attention from the users to learn more about her by having her social media links in the navigation bar's dropdown menu as well as the footer
6. Highlight the world-famous songs she sang to like the theme song for a James Bond movie because most people may know the songs but they may not know the artiste behind it 
7 To have all important features for different sized screens so as to not diminish any user experience to her website

The navigation bar is responsive for small, medium and large screens following Bootstrap's breakpoints. A hamburger icon with Lulu's theme orange color is available for small and medium screen on the top right corner of the website. A dropdown menu with links to different parts of the website allows the user to navigate there swiftly. When the screen is large-sized and above, the navigation bar displays the links on top of the screen instead. 

There is a highlighted small button with the theme color at the bottom right corner of the website to allow users to scroll swiftly back up the page. I had experienced with a button with the theme color or a border with theme color, but decided it is best for the site that the scroll up button remains as inonspicious as possible but still visible if the user wishes to utilise it.

The [landing](https://paddlepop25.github.io/trent-project1-lulu-website/) page is designed to 'wow' the user with a full-width carousel picture of full-house concerts. The carousel has a series of pictures and to give the user time to soak in the details of each picture, I set a comfortable time for the pictures to transition smoothly to the next one. Also, there are interactive arrows on the left and right sides which enables the user to see the previous/next picture quicker if he/she chooses to. For medium and large screens, the fictional venus are indicated at the bottom part of the photo. This leads to a more intimate picture of Lulu belting her lungs out with information of her first top no. 1 hit with chosen attractive words describing her such as "legendary" and "internationally known." 

Riding on information of her dazzling musical career, information of some of her tour are displayed in the [tour](https://paddlepop25.github.io/trent-project1-lulu-website/#tour) section. I used Bootstrap's cards to display her tour informatio for mobile view and Bootstrap's tables for medium and large sized screens. Media queries were used to adjust the buttons nicely as they were grouped together in a div. When the user hovers over the buttons, the color changes to indicate that they could be clicked and the user would be directed to a new page.

The first parallax image is introduced to suggest to the user a closer look of the audience in Lulu's concerts enjoying themselves and professing their love and admiration for the singer. I deliberately chose audience with hands raised in the air because that is what audiences usually do when they sing along to a familiar song or when they cheer for the singer. 

The [life in pictures](https://paddlepop25.github.io/trent-project1-lulu-website/#lifeinpics) section give a brief description of some of Lulu's acheivements over the years with accompanying pictures, because a picture tell a thousand words. A "read more" link is provided for the user to find out more information. The images in this section were strategically placed so they show a transition of a teen Lulu, a young adult Lulu and an older lady Lulu. Also, the first and last pictures are considerably longer in height than the middle one and in the bigger screens, they seem to 'wrap' around the center picture.


A second parallax of an image with bright light and hands raised brings the user back to Lulu's music theme, and this is followed by the [music](https://paddlepop25.github.io/trent-project1-lulu-website/#music) section with various cd covers and the respective titles. Due to space constraint, I limited the number of cds for small screens, and featured more for medium and larger screens. The images of the cd covers were deliberately placed to have the ones close to greyscale placed in the center, the top row featuring those with reddish tones and the bottom row featuring those with greenish tones. When the cd images are hovered over, it does a little spin dance to inject an element of surprise to the user. The cd titles are linked to amazon so the user could purchase the cd if he/she wishes to. Since the title is a link, when hovered over, it changes color to indicate a call of action from the use. 

## Features ##

Features on this website are:

* The links in the navigation bar changes to the theme color when hovered over to indicate that it is a link that the user could click on. This brings them to different sections of the website
* I introduced a smooth scrolling effect so the transition to another section of the website is not a "in your face" effect. This applies to the scroll-up button at the bottom right side of the website as well
* When hovering over any links, the cursor changes from a pointer to a hand to indicate that it is not a static word. An action could be made on the link to give the user more information
* A scroll button is provided at the bottom right hand side of the screen to allow the user to scroll to the top of the page without he/she having to manually scroll upwards
* The music section has a short, fun surprise for the user when he/she hovers over it, to stimulate a cd or laser disc spinning. The title of the cd is provided below and it is in the theme orange color which would enable the user to view more information on amazon as well as purchase the cd
* A form is provided for the user to be updated on news of Lulu as well as contact details if he/she wishes to have a reply from an administrator of the fan club.
* The google map indicates a venue where Lulu's concert is held
* A social media section is displayed in the footer section which allows the user to look at more Lulu photos and news instantly

Future features
* Display a few videos of Lulu's most famous and notable performances
* Quotes from producers, musicians and other notable artistes whom have worked with Lulu displayed in a picture montage with eye catching styling
* Provide a short clip of some of Lulu's songs when each cd is being hovered over in the music section

note: sadly, the scrolling effect is not supported in Safari browser
parallax effect doesn't work in mobile
A most recent article explains it [here](https://help.outofthesandbox.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001648767-Why-doesn-t-the-parallax-scrolling-effect-work-on-mobile-devices-) and strongly recommend to not include this feature because "it causes your site to "crash" user's browser apps or affect user conversions."
Removed parallax images for small and medium devices. Visual only large onwards
